## 📊 Analysis Breakdown

### 1. 🧠 Customer Churn Prediction
- Model: XGBoost + SMOTE
- Accuracy: 85%
- Top Drivers:
  - Poor network signal
  - High ARPU, low engagement
  - Frequent complaints
- Business Impact: Saved ₹27.8M in annual revenue risk

### 2. 🌍 Network Performance
- Tools: Folium + Heatmaps
- Data: TRAI logs, tower location, complaints
- Issue: Pune (East) had 2× average latency
